# DeloitteCaseStudy
Completed a Mentorship program with Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at University of California-San Diego and Deloitte. 
I got an opportunity to meet with a Data Scientist at Deloitte on a weekly basis and solved a case study with other students
who like me were selected to take part in the program. 
Three other students and I, worked as acting Deloitte employees to solve a case study which helps the United States Department of Labor,
We were provided with tons of Data which we had to use to Solve a question for the department of Labor.
